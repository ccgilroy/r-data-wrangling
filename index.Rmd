# Data wrangling

What do we mean by *data wrangling*? (Or "data munging", or even ["data janitoring"](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html)?)

Data wrangling is **everything you have to do to a data set to get it ready for analysis**

# How to wrangle data in R 

There's more than one way to do it! R has two main **dialects**: 

--

#### #1. **base** R

```{r eval=FALSE}
head(data.frame(giving)[(giving$`2016_dollars`<0 & !is.na(giving$`2016_dollars`)), 
                        c("transaction_amt","memo_text")], 100)

```

--

#### #2. the **tidyverse**

```{r eval=FALSE}
giving %>% 
  filter(`2016_dollars` < 0, !is.na(`2016_dollars`)) %>% 
  select(transaction_amt, memo_text) %>%
  head(100)
```

Many people mix the two. I'll teach a more pure tidyverse style.

**Note:** the tidyverse evolves over time. Use current packages that are well-established. Steer clear of retired packages (like **plyr**) or ones that are especially new (unless you need something cutting-edge)

---

# Key concepts 

tidyverse-style data transformation has 3 components

1. data (a data frame object)
2. verbs (functions)
3. the pipe (`%>%`) 

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
# this
some_data %>%
  do_something()

# is the same as this
do_something(some_data)
```

--

Why bother with the pipe? You can combine steps into a *series* of transformations

Remember, if you want to keep something, you also have to give it a name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
some_new_data <- 
  some_data %>%
  do_something() %>%
  do_something_else()
```

---

# Simple **dplyr** verbs

#### `select()` - choose columns (variables) by name

```{r}
gss %>% select(id, sex, race)

# remove columns with -name
gss %>% select(-year)

# there are select helpers too
gss %>% select(starts_with("vote"))
```

--

#### `filter()` - choose rows (observations) by some characteristics

```{r}
gss %>% filter(age < 50)

# "a equals b" is `a == b`
gss %>% filter(race == "BLACK")

# `!` means "not"
gss %>% filter(!is.na(divorce))
```

--

#### `arrange()` - put data in order by one or more variables

```{r}
gss %>% arrange(age, race)
```

---

# Simple **dplyr** verbs

#### `select()` - choose columns (variables) by name

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss %>% select(id, sex, race)
```

---

# Simple **dplyr** verbs

#### `filter()` - choose rows (observations) by some characteristics

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss %>% filter(race == "BLACK")
```

---

# Simple **dplyr** verbs

#### `arrange()` - put data in order by one or more variables

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss %>% arrange(desc(age))
```


---

# Making summaries

#### `group_by()` creates groups from variables

#### `summarize()` aggregates a set of rows

--

Combine `group_by()` + `summarize()` to make group-wise summaries: 

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss %>%
  group_by(sex, race) %>%
  summarize(age = mean(age))
```

**Note:** You can also use `group_by()` with `mutate()`. When might that be useful?

---

# Making new variables

Create new variables with the verb `mutate()`: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_data <- 
  data %>%
  mutate(new_variable = some_function(old_variable))
```

The key is that the function needs to work on a *vector*. Why? Because columns of data frames are vectors, and mutate transforms a whole column.

For example, `+` works on vectors: 

```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)
x + y
```

---

# Making new variables

Because `+` works on vectors, we can use `mutate()` to create a new column `z` by adding `x` and `y`: 

```{r eval=TRUE}
d <- tibble(x, y)

d %>%
  mutate(z = x + y)
```

---

# More on making new variables

#### Change the type of a variable

```{r}
gss %>% mutate(age = as.numeric(age))
```

`as.numeric`, `as.character`, `as.factor` (and `as_factor`) ... 

--

#### Test a TRUE/FALSE condition

```{r}
gss %>% mutate(divorce_bin = ifelse(divorce == "YES", 1, 0))

gss %>% mutate(divorce_lgl = (divorce == "YES"), 
               divorce_dbl = as.numeric(divorce_lgl))
```

--

#### Factors with **forcats**

Factors represent categorical data. forcats functions of the form `forcats::fct_*()` manipulate factors. 

--

#### Text data with **stringr**

Characters (also called *strings*) represent text data. stringr functions of the form `stringr::str_*()` manipulate strings.

---

# More on making new variables - factors

#### Factors with **forcats**

Factors represent categorical data. forcats functions of the form `forcats::fct_*()` manipulate factors. Useful functions include

- `fct_relevel`: change the order of the factor levels (categories). In an R model, the *first* level is the reference category
- `fct_drop`: get rid of levels that don't appear in the data
- `fct_recode`: manually change factor levels
- `fct_collapse`: manually combine factor levels
- `fct_reorder`: reorder levels based on a second variable (good for plotting)

--

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss_divorce <- 
  gss %>%
  mutate(divorce = fct_drop(divorce), 
         divorce = fct_relevel(divorce, "NO", "YES")) 

levels(gss_divorce$divorce)
```

---

# More on making new variables - strings

#### Text data with **stringr**

Characters (also called *strings*) represent text data. stringr functions of the form `stringr::str_*()` manipulate strings. Useful functions include

- `str_c`: combine strings
- `str_detect`: TRUE/FALSE if a pattern is in the string
- `str_extract`: pattern detection, but gives you the pattern itself
- `str_replace`, `str_replace_all`: replace a pattern 

--

**Note:** To get the most out of working with text data, you'll need to learn a bit about ***regular expressions*** ("regex"), a general way for representing text patterns. For instance, with regex you can find:

- the beginning of a piece of text (`"^"`), or the end (`"$"`)
- any number (`"[0-9]"` or `"\\d"`)
- any number of numbers (`"[0-9]*"`, or `"[0-9]+"` for at least one)

---

# Other good stuff

*You might need to do these things, you might not. It's good to know they exist.*

--

#### Reshape data with `tidyr::pivot_longer()` and `tidyr::pivot_wider()`

Sometimes it's better to have data in "long" form for visualization and "wide" form for modeling. 

--

#### Join data sets with `dplyr::left_join()`

If you have more than one table, you can join them using identifying variables.

--

#### Apply functions with `purrr::map()`

If you want to use a normal, non-vector function inside mutate, the purrr package can "map" any function to a list or vector of values. 

**Note:** `map()` returns a list, but often you want a vector---use `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, `map_lgl()`, ..., to get a vector column of the appropriate type.

---

# An advanced example

If you want a challenge, try to understand how this code works. It fits a separate model to each wave of the gss panel data.

```{r eval=TRUE}
gss_nested <- 
  gss %>% 
  group_by(wave) %>% 
  nest()

gss_nested %>%
  mutate(fit = map(data, ~lm(age ~ race + sex, data = .)))
```

---

# Rewriting code in a tidyverse style

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
data("gss_panel10_long")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
test <- 
  gss_panel10_long %>% 
  dplyr::select("earthsun", 
                names(gss_panel10_long)[grep("sci", names(gss_panel10_long))]) %>%
  filter(is.na(earthsun) == FALSE)

## Some of these we grabbed, dont't make sense, e.g., vissci
test <- test[, -which(colnames(test) == "uscitzn")]
test <- test[, -which(colnames(test) == "vissci")]

sum_sci <- apply(data.frame(test)[, -1], 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(sum_sci))
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
test <-
  gss_panel10_long %>%
  dplyr::select(earthsun, contains("sci")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(earthsun)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-uscitzn, -vissci, -earthsun)

# TODO: find a tidier way to sum rows...
test %>% 
  mutate(sum_sci = rowSums(., na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  summarize(sum_sci = sum(is.na(sum_sci)))
```
